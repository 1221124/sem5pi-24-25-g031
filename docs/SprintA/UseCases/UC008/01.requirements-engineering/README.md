**From the specifications document:**

//Preencher

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Is it mandatory for patients to have a user account to schedule a surgery?
> 
> **Answer:** No, patients are not required to have a user account. The system administrator creates patient profiles.

> **Question:** Can a user have both patient and healthcare staff profiles?
> 
> **Answer:** No, a user cannot have both profiles. Staff and patients have separate identifications.

> **Question:** How are duplicate patient profiles handled when registered by both the patient and admin?
>

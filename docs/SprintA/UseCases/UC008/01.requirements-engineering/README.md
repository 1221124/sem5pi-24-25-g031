---

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

//Preencher

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Is it mandatory for patients to have a user account to schedule a surgery?
> 
> **Answer:** No, patients are not required to have a user account. The system administrator creates patient profiles.

> **Question:** Can a user have both patient and healthcare staff profiles?
> 
> **Answer:** No, a user cannot have both profiles. Staff and patients have separate identifications.

> **Question:** How are duplicate patient profiles handled when registered by both the patient and admin?
> 
> **Answer:** The system checks the email for uniqueness. The admin must first create the patient record, and then the patient can register using the same email.

> **Question:** So, when the administrator starts creating the patient profile, what format(s) of the date of birth will they need to enter? Furthermore, what will be the format of the Medical Record Number generated after recording the data?
> 
> **Answer:** From a usability perspective, dates should be presented to the user using the operating system's locale definitions. since for this sprint you are building an API, you should use a standard format like ISO 8601.
Medical record numbers are generated by the system following the format YYYYMMnnnnnn where YYYY and MM are the year and month of the registration and nnnnnn is a sequential number

> **Question:** Can you give an example of a Patient's medical record?
> 
> **Answer:** Patient Medical Record

> **Question:** In the project documentation there are two concepts related to the Patient: Medical Records and Appointment History. Can you tell us what's the difference between the two? Or are these both the same concept?
> 
> **Answer:** The appointment history in this case is the list of surgeries the patient has had in the past and the scheduled or requested operations.
A medical record is a comprehensive and organized collection of information about a patient's medical history, diagnoses, treatments, and healthcare interactions.

> **Question:** It is specified that the admin can input some of the patient's information (name, date of birth, contact information, and medical history). Do they also input the omitted information (gender, emergency contact and allergies/medical condition)?
Additionally, does the medical history that the admin inputs refer to the patient's medical record, or is it referring to the appointment history?
> 
> **Answer:** the admin can not input medical history nor allergies. they can however input gender and emergency contact



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

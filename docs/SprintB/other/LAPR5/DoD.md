# Definition of Done (DoD)

## Purpose
The **Definition of Done (DoD)** ensures consistent criteria for determining when a task, user story, sprint, or the entire project has been successfully completed. This serves to maintain quality standards, foster transparency, and meet stakeholder expectations in the **Surgical Appointment and Resource Management (SARMS)** project.

## General Criteria
For a task or feature to be considered "done," it must fulfill the following conditions:
- **Code Quality:**
    - Code adheres to the project's coding standards.
    - Peer-reviewed with no major issues identified during the review process.
    - No critical or high-severity bugs identified.
- **Functionality:**
    - All acceptance criteria in the user story are met.
    - End-to-end functionality tested and demonstrated successfully.
- **Testing:**
    - Unit tests are written, passing, and provide at least 90% code coverage.
    - Integration tests between modules have been completed successfully.
    - UI and user acceptance testing (UAT) completed with approval from stakeholders.
- **Documentation:**
    - Inline comments in the codebase where necessary.
    - Relevant module and feature documentation updated.
    - Deployment or usage instructions are clear and validated.
- **Compliance:**
    - GDPR requirements verified (e.g., handling of sensitive patient data).
    - Fail over and business continuity processes reviewed and implemented where applicable.
- **Deployment:**
    - Successfully integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    - Feature tested in a staging environment and validated for production readiness.

## Final Project Delivery Criteria
- All modules (Backoffice, Planning, 3D Visualization, GDPR, Business Continuity) are integrated seamlessly.
- Documentation (technical, user-facing, and compliance-related) is comprehensive and accessible.
- Stakeholder acceptance and approval received.
- Deployment to a DEI VM validated and accessible per specifications.
- Risks, limitations, and next steps clearly outlined for potential production deployment.

## Additional Notes
This DoD is subject to revision based on feedback during Sprint B or updates in project scope. Collaboration and communication among team members are essential to ensure criteria are consistently met.

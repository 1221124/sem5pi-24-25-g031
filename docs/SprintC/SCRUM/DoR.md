# Definition of Ready (DoR)

## Purpose
The **Definition of Ready (DoR)** establishes clear and consistent criteria for determining when a task, user story, or sprint backlog item is prepared to be worked on. This ensures that the team can proceed without significant blockers and that the work is well-defined in the context of the **Surgical Appointment and Resource Management (SARMS)** project.

---

## General Criteria
For a task or user story to be considered "ready", it must meet the following conditions:
- **Clarity:**
    - The user story is clearly written and understandable by all team members.
    - The scope of the task is well-defined and aligns with the project's objectives.
    - Acceptance criteria are explicitly stated, unambiguous, and testable.
- **Feasibility:**
    - The task or story is achievable within a single sprint or broken down into smaller, manageable components.
    - Dependencies on other tasks, stories, or modules are identified and documented.
    - All required technical and domain knowledge is available to the team.
- **Requirements:**
    - Necessary input data, mockups, or resources (e.g., APIs, database schemas) are available.
    - Legal or compliance requirements, such as GDPR, are understood and incorporated.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:**
    - The task has been reviewed and prioritized by the Product Owner or relevant stakeholders.
    - Any open questions or ambiguities have been resolved.
- **Readiness for Development:**
    - Risks and challenges have been identified and mitigated where possible.
    - All required tools, libraries, or development environments are set up and accessible.

## Final Readiness Criteria
- All modules and their integration points are clearly defined.
- Necessary external systems (e.g., IAM, deployment environment) are operational.
- All documentation, including GDPR policies and technical specifications, is up to date.
- Sprint backlog items for the final sprint are approved by stakeholders and meet DoR requirements.

## Additional Notes
This DoR is subject to revision as the project progresses. The team is encouraged to raise concerns or request clarification when a task or story does not meet readiness criteria before committing to work.

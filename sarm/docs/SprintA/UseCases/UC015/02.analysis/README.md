## 2. Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

![UC015 - Domain Model](svg/uc015-domain-model.svg)

### 2.2. Process Specification

#### 2.2.1. Normal Flow

1. **Authenticate Admin**: Verify that the Admin is logged in with the appropriate permissions.
2. **Access Staff Management Interface**: Admin navigates to the staff profile management section in the back office.
3. **Enter Search Criteria**: Admin inputs the search criteria (name, email, specialization).
4. **Display Search Results**: The system displays a list of staff profiles that match the search criteria.
5. **Select Staff Profile**: Admin selects a staff profile from the list of results.
6. **View Staff Profile Details**: The system displays the full details of the selected staff profile.
7. **Edit or Deactivate Profile**: Admin can update the profile information or deactivate the staff profile.
8. **Confirm Action**: The system provides feedback to the Admin on the success or failure of the edit/deactivation operation.
9. **Record Action**: The system logs the operation (edit or deactivation) for auditing and management purposes.

#### 2.2.2. Exceptional Flows

- **EF015.1**: If an error occurs when attempting to deactivate or edit the profile, the system must notify the Admin and log the error in the system.

### 2.3. Functional Requirements Reevaluation

- **FR015.1**: The system shall allow admins to search staff profiles by name, email, or specialization.
- **FR015.2**: The system shall display the search results in a paginated list, showing key staff information.
- **FR015.3**: The system shall allow the Admin to view, edit, or deactivate staff profiles directly from the search results.
- **FR015.4**: The system shall provide filtering and pagination options to refine the search results.

### 2.4. Non-functional Requirements Specification

- **Security**: Implement role-based access control to ensure only authorized admins can edit or deactivate staff profiles.
- **Performance**: Ensure that the search and display of results are performed within acceptable time limits, even with large data volumes.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive, guiding the Admin through the search and editing/deactivation process efficiently.

### 2.5. Data Integrity and Security

- Data integrity measures should ensure that search, edit, and deactivation operations are accurately reflected in the system without compromising data consistency.
- Security measures should prevent unauthorized access to staff profile management functions and protect sensitive staff data.

### 2.6. Interface Design

- The interface should support an efficient workflow for searching staff profiles with clear filtering and pagination options.

### 2.7. Risk Analysis

- **R015.1**: System error during deactivation or profile editing
  - **Mitigation**: Implement error handling mechanisms to notify the Admin of failures and provide guidance on how to proceed.
- **R015.2**: Unauthorized access to staff profile management functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Implement encryption standards for storing and transmitting user credentials to prevent unauthorized access.

### 2.8. Decisions

- **D030.1**: Use role-based access control to restrict access to the edit and deactivate functionalities for staff profiles.
- **D030.2**: Implement pagination to enhance usability when displaying large search result sets.
- **D030.3**: Implement a logging mechanism to record operations (edit or deactivation) for audit purposes.
- **D030.4**: Use the provided domain model as a reference for implementing the staff profile search and management functionalities.
